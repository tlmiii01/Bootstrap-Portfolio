                    <p>I have been working on computers for over 30 years. When I was in elementary school, I (well, my mother,
                        but that is a different story) sold over 70 magazine subscriptions during a magazine drive. One of
                        the prizes that was available was a computer...the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. This computer came
                        with 16 KBof RAM and used a cassette recorder to store data.</p>
                    <p>One thing that I am
                        <strong>REALLY</strong> passionate about is coffee. About six years ago, a good friend of mine mentioned
                        that I was doing coffee wrong. The next day, he brought a jar with coffee beans in it. When I asked
                        the difference, he said that roasted them himself. I tried the coffee and nothing has been the same
                        ever since.</p>
                    <p>First, it was buying beans from my friend. Next, it was a roaster. Then, another roaster, because I burned
                        out a motor. After another roaster, I upgraded to a better roaster. Next, I started maintaining spreadsheets
                        tracking datapoints.</p>
